# Azyrel: Path To Ascension (Working Title)

This project is a (stub), please support it by sending Akyra tons of love!

A brief description of the project: This game is a 2D fast-paced
platformer heavily inspired by Dustforce with changes to include more expressive
combat and magic gameplay while also roping in my take on high fantasy. The story follows
between four playable characters who each have their own respective weapon class and
two types of magics.

#### Azyrel Angelo
is a blond haired spellsword from a village in Callestine Forest who recently lost
his mother immediately prior to the start of his journey. His memory is hazy and
wishes to find his missing father who must know the origin of a recently appeared
accursed. He wields a straight sword and has mastery of both ice and fire magic.

#### Akyra Synthia
is a red haired knight from the Sky Isles who seeks revenge for her
fallen brother who she lost to the aforementioned accursed. She travels far in spite
of her duty to uncover the mystery that brought havoc to the world. She wields a
greatsword and has mastery of spirit arts and chaos magic.

#### Leo Kanthor
is an orphaned scholar from the Great Plains looking to learn more
about the accursed and the secrets hidden behind draconic tongue. He later joins
the two in search for his own particular interests. He wields two daggers and
has mastery of wind and thunder magic.

#### Fae Nightwolf
is an Elven mercenary from the Crystal Islands with the task of investigating the
process of ascension. She follows the path of the accursed in hopes of learning
more about the rites and the elder dragons. She wields a lance and has mastery
of time and blood magic.
